# MEAN Stack RESTful API Application - Contact List App


This repo contains the code for a RESTful API Contact List App that was built using the MEAN stack:

<ul>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Express</li>
<li>AngularJS</li>
<li>NodeJS</li>
</ul>

Make sure MongoDB is running, and then go to source code directory and run the code with 

    node server

You might see a message that says, 

    Error: Module did not self-register.]
    js-bson: Failed to load c++ bson extension, using pure JS version
Simply ignore that.
